[OFFAPPS-XXX] Short description

## Description
Develop what, but also why this PR exists. The "Why" is as much, if not more important than the "What". I use this approach very often when I write commit messages, because if the code is clear enough it should already answer the "what" question. The "why" is often more subtle.

## Tasks
- [ ] Write tests

## Implementation notes
I don't always use this section, but I do when I find there's something particularly tricky end/or nifty in the code.
